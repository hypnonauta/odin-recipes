Odin Project about cooking recipes.

The index page contains links to the recipes I chose for this project.
Each recipe is in a different html page.
The recipes pages all have the same elements:
- Name of the recipe
- Recipe's dish image
- Description
- Ingredients
- Method

What I learned:
- Headings
- Unordered lists
- Oredered lists
- Document metadata
- html anchors
- Inserting images
